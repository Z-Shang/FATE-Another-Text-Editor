# Yet-Another-Text-Editor
A Text Editor Specialized for Small Touch Screen Devices

##Why New Wheel AGAIN
**TL;DR**

'Cuz I Want

---
I just got a 8-inch tablet running Windows 10 and I tried to write some code on it (by imagining an awesome experience like holding a cute small device and writing whatever I want), but I found it struggling with the lack of support of touch screen devices on existing text editors (mainly Visual Studio Code) and the strange on screen keyboard. So I decided to create a wheel by myself.

##Possible Features
- Built-in touch keyboard designed for small touch devices
- VIM-like multiple modes (so you are freed from poking your screen for a small button)
- Cross platform (Nah, it is just JavaScript)
- Probably plugin support (And less possible: partly compatible with Atom's plugin)
- You say
